# README

This repository is dedicated to the creation of trajectory history and heat maps in generic floor plans.
The idea is to use a plant as a background image and put the historical data on top.

## Requirements

Libraries ```matplotib``` and ```pandas``` are necessary.
```
$ pip install matplotlib pandas
```

## Run

Running with this command will show the floorplan plot
```
$ python main.py
```

After running a plot like this must be displayed:
